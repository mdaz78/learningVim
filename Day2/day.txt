Hello, this is Day 2 of my Vim journey.

Today, I will practice:
- Entering Insert Mode
- Deleting text in various ways
- Undoing and redoing changes

Let's try some basic delete commands now:
1. This is a sample line to delete the first character.
2. Here is a word that I might delete using dw.
3. Here's a whole line that I will delete using dd.
4. I will delete text until the end of this line using D.

Undo the changes and redo them to see the changes.
