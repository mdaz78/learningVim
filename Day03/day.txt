This is your Day 3 practice file for Vim.

You're going to practice navigating:
- by words using w, e, b, ge
- to the start and end of lines using 0, ^, $

You'll also search this file using / and ?

Let's try searching for the word 'search' and 'line'.

Try using 'n' and 'N' to repeat searches in both directions.
