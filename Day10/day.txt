# Day 10: Buffer and Window Management

# Buffer 1: Main Content
This is the main buffer content.
Practice switching between buffers using:
- :ls (list buffers)
- :b1, :b2, etc. (switch to buffer by number)
- :bn (next buffer)
- :bp (previous buffer)

# Buffer 2: Configuration
# Sample configuration file
port = 3000
host = "localhost"
debug = true
log_level = "info"

# Buffer 3: Source Code
function example() {
    const greeting = "Hello";
    const name = "World";
    return `${greeting}, ${name}!`;
}

# Window Management Practice
1. Split windows horizontally (:sp)
2. Split windows vertically (:vsp)
3. Navigate between windows (Ctrl-w + h,j,k,l)
4. Resize windows (Ctrl-w + <,>,+,-)
5. Close windows (:q)

Remember:
- :ls : list all buffers
- :b name : switch to buffer by name
- :bd : delete current buffer
- Ctrl-w s : split horizontal
- Ctrl-w v : split vertical
- Ctrl-w c : close window
- Ctrl-w o : close other windows
