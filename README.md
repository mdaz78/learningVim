# 🧠 Vim Mastery in 30 Days

Welcome to my journey to mastering Vim as a full-time developer tool in 30 days.

## 📅 Daily Plan

This repository tracks my daily exercises, drills, configs, and reflections as I work through a structured Vim learning curriculum tailored for developers using:

- **Neovim / Vim**
- **VSCodeVim**
- **IdeaVim**

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- JavaScript / TypeScript / React / Next.js
- Ruby
- Java
- Neovim + LazyVim

---

## ✅ Goals

- Use Vim fluently with zero mouse dependence
- Replace VSCode with Neovim for JS/TS/Ruby/Java projects
- Master buffer navigation, LSPs, Telescope, Treesitter, Git integration, and more
